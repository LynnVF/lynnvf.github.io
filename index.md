I am a postdoc in the vision group at [Disney Research Zurich].
Previously, I was a postdoc working with [Fredo Durand] and [Sylvain Paris]
at [MIT]. I completed my PhD under the guidance of [George Drettakis]
at [INRIA] in the beautiful French Riviera. I obtained my Masters degree in
computer science at [ENSIMAG]. In an earlier life, I used to be an undergrad
at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi].
