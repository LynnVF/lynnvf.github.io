Hi, I am an undergraduate at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China] & [University of Glasgow]. My research interests focus on applying machine learning to solve practical problems, including ultrasound imaging analysis, object detection and data mining.
I am currently a research intern in [electrical & computer engineering department], Rutgers University, where I researched under the guidance of [Prof. Bo Yuan].
