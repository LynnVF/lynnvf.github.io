{% include image.html url="images/profile_1.jpg" width="300px" align="right" %}

I am a cognitive neuroscientist passionate about personalized healthcare and helping patients with neurological disorders. I have experience in coordinating and managing cross-sectional and longitudinal projects with clinical populations, conducting neurobiological assessments (MRI, EEG), data analysis, teaching and disseminating scientific findings to experts and the general public.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Developmental Neuroscience group (principial investigator: Prof. Nora M. Raschle) at the [Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/developmental_neuroscience/home.html).
