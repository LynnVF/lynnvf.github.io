I am a cognitive neuroscientist interested in personalized healthcare. I have experience in coordinating and managing cross-sectional and longitudinal projects with clinical and non-clinical populations, conducting neurobiological assessments (MRI, EEG), data analysis, teaching and dissemination of scientific findings to experts and the general public. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Developmental Neuroscience group (Prof. Nora M. Raschle) at the [Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/developmental_neuroscience/home.html).
