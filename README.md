Jekyll based webpage using [Prof. Steve Miller's](http://svmiller.com) [jekyll theme](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template). Please refer to Prof. Miller's repo for license. Since this work is a derivative of Prof. Miller's, therefore it is only fair that I honour his self-deprecating spirit and name this **much-worse**.

Most jekyll themes are meant for blogs or single page websites. This is an academic website that supports blogs. I have changed the typography, color schemes and some spacing to suit the taste of a dull computer scientist. I also added optional support for site analytics and comments.

Feel free to send me pull requests with better responsive performance or cleaner HTML/CSS.
