I like reading classics -- they never disappoint. My all time favourites are 1984 by Orwell (of course); Hemingway's war descriptions, Wilde' wit and Kafka' nightmarish world. I used to be a big fan of Enid Blyton as a kid; someday childhood will return and I will read more of those gemstones.

I also enjoy reading about political revolutionaries or satirists. Common sense by Thomas Paine is my favourte.

Feel free to offer reading suggestions :)
